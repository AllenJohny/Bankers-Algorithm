For the bankers algorithm I first use fscanf to obtain the required values from an input file("input.txt").Then using the number of processes i calculate all possible sequence permutations for it. Then I check each permutation for bankers algorithm and whether its a safe sequence or not. Finally the total number of safe sequences and all the safe sequences are printed lexicographically as output.

note: This program might not work in some of the older version c compilers. Requires c99.
